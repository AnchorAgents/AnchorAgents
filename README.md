# Hi there, I'm Leonardo Pimentel 👋

### Python Backend Engineer | AI & Automation Architect

I am a Software Engineer with a unique background: **13 years in Sanitation & Infrastructure Project Management** turned into **Code Architecture**.

In 2024, I transitioned from designing hydraulic networks to architecting **Digital Systems**. I realized that managing data flows, preventing bottlenecks, and ensuring system resilience requires the exact same engineering mindset used in critical infrastructure.

Today, I lead **Anchor Agents**, focusing on building autonomous systems that work harder so you don't have to.

### 🛠️ Engineering Stack

* **Core:** Python (Expert), SQL, Logic & Algorithms.
* **Backend & Architecture:** Django, DRF, REST APIs, Microservices.
* **AI & Agents:** LLM Integration, Autonomous Agents (LangChain/CrewAI), Process Automation.
* **Infrastructure:** Docker, CI/CD, Cloud Deployment.

### 🏗️ Why "Anchor Agents"?

In nautical engineering, an anchor provides stability. In software, **Agents** provide autonomy.
My mission is to build software that is both **stable (Robust Architecture)** and **autonomous (AI-Driven)**.
